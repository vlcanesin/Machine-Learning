# Machine Learning with Python
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks with example projects from the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn, Keras &amp; TensorFlow", 2nd edition, Aurélien Géron.

**Note:** these notebooks are meant only for demonstration porpouses. For the sake of simplicity, the data files (and everything except the notebooks) were not uploaded to the repository.

## Projects in this repository
  1. **Housing Prices Predictor:** introduction of regression models and techniques for data analysis and dataset segmenting
  2. **MNIST:** data analysis for classification tasks and general classification techniques applied in the MNIST dataset
  3. **Titanic Classificator:** creating a model for the task of classifying if a given passenger from the Titanic survived or not
  4. **Ensembled Learning:** experimenting with different ensembling techniques in the MNIST dataset
  5. **Dimensionality Reduction:** dimensionality reduction algorithms for increasing performance and generating data visualisations
  6. **Unsupervised Learning:** algorithms for general unsupervised learning tasks and anomaly detection
  7. **Keras Intro:** introduction of Neural Networks, trained on the MNIST dataset
  8. **Deep Neural Networks:** general techniques (normalization/regularization) for dealing with the learning in Deep Neural Networks
  9. **CNNs for Computer Vision:** using Convolutional Neural Networks for classifying landscapes (taken from Google Images)
  10. **RNNs Intro:** using Recurrent Neural Networks for classification in a dataset of sketches (QuickDraw)
